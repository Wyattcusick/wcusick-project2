        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Wyatt began his dive into music junior year of high school first showing up under the name <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@3lilpigs884">“3 lil pigs”</a> making “Glizzy Gladiators.” This was the earliest instance where we could see his influences alive and working. We could see the track playing blurring the lines between electronic, hip hop, and pop. Wyatt drew from artists like The Postal Service, Kanye, and Kaytranada. He would release a beat tape, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZUnIaFc4PE&list=PLUxwt3jhIAajuB5SvFWzAn3wVatk1B_nR&ab_channel=WyattCusick">"Early Bird"</a> then one after, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyP8xxb4gMM&list=PLUxwt3jhIAajZrLOnI_8uy_it_E6quQgx&ab_channel=WyattCusick">"Cow"</a> which both drew from these genres and artists. Wyatt’s releases would drop off and he would appear again with a more RnB sound while he had shifted his sound you could still clearly see his early influences. As Wyatt has taken off from his home town heading down to New Orleans he has begun working with more artists and created tons of music that is yet to be released. He’s kept true to his music roots but has begun to make a deep plunge into RnB. This new version of Wyatt Cusick is working in full capacity at Loyola University of New orleans.</p>
